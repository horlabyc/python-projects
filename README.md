# :snake: Python Programs :snake:
 > A list of python projects created while learning the language as it relates to ethical hacking and cyber security. Most tools work as is, some need to be converted to python3 and there is a full TODO list as well for each one. This list is not conclusive nor complete, and more projects will be added as I get them completed and operational.

simple_mac_changer usage:  
`python3 simple_mac_changer.py <interface> <MAC>`  
- user provides interface and what MAC to set manually *no input validation*  

mac_changer usage:  
`python3 mac_changer.py -i interface`
* generates random hex MAC value
* more verbosity on process

### Network Scanner

Usage:  
`python3 netscan.py -t ip/subnet`

Will return Responding IP and MAC Address of the scanned network range

---

### Python WebApp Login Cracker

A simple login page cracker using a supplied username and wordlist file for passwords.

        * .xls / .xlsx        
        * .csv
        * *others*

- Network Scanner
    - Obtain host info
    - Add port scanning within the script
    - Obtain port service informaiton like nmap once included
    - Add execution for simple exploit checks (anon FTP, SSH enum, SMB mapping, rpcclient, etc)

- Login Cracker
    - Argument to accept username file
    - Try all options with supplied user/pass files not locating first successful login
    - Support for : separated files (user:pass)
